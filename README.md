# Creating And Using Segue in Xcode

- To create and use segue first of all we will require two viewcontrollers. And I have created two of them namely `ViewController` and `SecondViewController` and both are there in storyboard as well.
- Lets say in our first viewcontroller we add a button from object directory by dragging and dropping uibutton in the viewcontroller, this button will take us from first to second viewcontroller.
- In order to that we need to setup a segue and setting up a segue is very easy. All you need to do is just click the button, hold down the control key on keyboard and click and drag and point to the secondviewcontroller.
- You will see a popup of types of segue, chose Show from the options. It can be change at point of development time if needed later on.
